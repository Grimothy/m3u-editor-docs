# Mapping EPG to Playlist

## Provider EPG and Playlist

If you're using your provider Playlist and EPG url, the mapping should work without any modifications. Simply head to the **Channels** section and select the **Map EPG to Playlist** option from the **Actions** dropdown. Select your Playlist and EPG to perform the mapping on and press **Map now** to begin. You can configure to run on each EPG sync as well.

## Custom EPG(s) and Playlist

If you're using a different EPG source(s), and the mapping isn't working as expected, you can map the EPG to the Playlist by following these steps:
- To solve for auto-mapping not working, you can manually edit each channel you wish to assign an EPG to and select the EPG channel from the dropdown list.
